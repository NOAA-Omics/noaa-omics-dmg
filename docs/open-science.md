Open Science Principles
=======

## Motivation

The advantages of good data management for NOAA's mission, including machine readability and compliance with US Government mandates.
</br>

### Why manage data

The **FAIR data principles** were defined in the 2016 *Scientific Data* paper [The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) and are listed [here](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). The criteria of the FAIR principles are as follows:

* Findable – Data/metadata should be richly described, include the identifier of the data they describe, be assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier, and be indexed in a searchable resource.
* Accessible – Data/metadata should be retrievable by an identifier using a standardized communications protocol, which is open, free, and universally implementable, and the metadata should be accessible even when the data are no longer available.
* Interoperable – Data/metadata should use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation, using vocabularies that follow FAIR principles, and include qualified references to other metadata and/or data.
* Reusable – Data/metadata are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes, are released with a clear and accessible data usage license, are associated with detailed provenance, and meet domain-relevant community standards.

## Findable & Accessible

### How to find NOAA and other data, and how to make your data findable (keywords, persistent identifiers, cross-listing)
* List of keywords to include with 'Omics studies: [add controlled Omics vocab list here]
* Register for an [ORCiD](https://data.gov/developers/blog/primer-machine-readability-online-documents-and-data/index.html), which links all of your research works to a persistent and unique identifier.
* Cross-list publications and other research material on platforms like [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/) and [Biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/)  
* Utilize DOIs or accession numbers whenever cross-listing data, metadata, code, and publications. Do not only include a URL!

### Standard language for publications

All raw sequence files associated with this study can be found in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under BioProject PRJN####. Environmental and sample metadata is available at NCEI [accession number here]. Processed datasets and analysis scripts generated from this study are available in a Github repository [insert URL here] with the Zenodo DOI [insert DOI here].

</br>

## Interoperable & Reusable

### Licenses

Understand the licenses associated with data when submitted to repositories, and include an appropriate license with provided code.
[include boilerplate license required for federal employees. Make recommendation for license for other users]


</br>

### Machine readability

* A [Primer on Machine Readability](https://data.gov/developers/blog/primer-machine-readability-online-documents-and-data/index.html) outlines various data types and file formats, as well as how and why they should be machine readable.

## Government mandates

* [White House Executive Order - Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information (2013)](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-)
* [NOAA Plan for Increasing Public Access to Research Results (PARR) (2015)](https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/review2016/reviewer_docs/NOAA_PARR_Plan_v5.04.pdf) (also see [PARR website](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/parr.html))
